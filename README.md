# Algorithm Challenge #31 – Count Letters (Match Case or Ignore Case) | Level 3

🔎 **Problem Description**
-
This challenge reads a string and a character from the user,
then counts how many times the character appears in the string using two modes:

- Case-sensitive counting
- Case-insensitive counting

Example:
-
Input:  
String: MaMMa  
Character: m  

Output:  
Match Case Count = 1  
Ignore Case Count = 5

💡 **What You’ll Learn**
-
- Designing case-sensitive and case-insensitive algorithms
- Using default parameters for flexible behavior
- Normalizing characters for comparison
- Writing configurable and reusable functions
- Understanding real-world text matching rules

---

🧩 **Algorithm Concept**
-
This problem demonstrates a **configurable linear search algorithm**.

Key ideas:
- Same algorithm, different behavior
- Logic controlled by parameters
- Character normalization using `tolower()`
- O(n) time complexity with predictable performance

Such logic is widely used in:
- Search engines
- User input validation
- Text filters
- Data preprocessing pipelines
